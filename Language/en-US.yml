      STR_HOSTAGE_CRISIS_BRIEFING: A hostage crisis is taking place in an office complex owned by a Security Council member government. A group of Terrorists have barricaded themselves inside the complex and taken prisoner the government personnel. Our mission is to storm the building, neutralize the terrorists and rescue the hostages alive.  A Mi-8 helicopter from an allied country has been loaned to us for this operation, some of our troops will fast-rope from it, while some other will assault the building from the lower floors.

The aircraft is parked on a runway at the local airport. Our mission will be to storm the plane, neutralize the hostiles and avoid civilian casualties at all costs. Extreme caution, it's a closed environment and a stray bullet could injure someone.
      STR_HUMAN_TERROR_ATTACK: Terrorist Attack
      STR_URBAN_TERROR_BRIEFING: A squad of terrorists has started an attack on a city and we have been called upon to support the local authorities. The reason for the assault is not known, but there is speculation that the enemy is trying to make a show of force, perhaps directed at members of other anarchist groups.

Its main function is to quickly pack wounds, which contains as a side effect the mitigation of pain (although at the moment of applying the foam it is extremely painful), as well as a slight increase of the patient's health. One of the few medical instruments that can be used in outer space. "

      STR_GENERATOR_STICK_UFOPEDIA: "A new type of Generator Stick has been developed specifically for use on space missions. Thanks to the new alien technology, the control unit of the shock generator with super reduced recoil and the creation of the alien alloy body itself has been redesigned, which allows the use of this device by UNEXCOM soldiers with great ease without losing the power of the weapon itself."
      STR_SPACE_KNIFE_UFOPEDIA: "Space-Capable Tactical Knife, special melee weapon meant to be used with astronaut gloves. It features a hardened Alien Alloy blade with a custom retractile handle that folds itself to cover the metal and avoid puncturing a space suit while stored. It can cut through several layers of armor."
      STR_GYROJET_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Compact and ultra-precise gun, it is famous for being very quiet. It is basically the original model of Gyrojet gun created by the company MBA in the 60s, but adapted to use removable magazines. Soldiers call it 'the space spy gun' because of its stealthy qualities and ability to be used in the total vacuum of space."
      STR_GYROJET_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Co-designed with the original creators of the Gyrojet concept, MBA and the American company Colt, this combat rifle is similar to the Gyrojet rifle presented by MBA to the U.S. Army a few years ago, with several internal differences: the firing mechanism was adapted so that it can be fed with removable mags, instead of the internal fixed magazine of the original model, and the wood was replaced with polymers qualified for use in space."
      STR_GYROJET_AMMO_MAGAZINE_UFOPEDIA: "The rocket ammunition used by our guns is visually similar to a .45 caliber ACP bullet, but over-dimensioned. Inside carries a special propellant charge within a self-contained casing, basically making it a micro missile. It can operate in the vacuum of space. Its penetration capacity is considerable for a bullet of its size, but it suffers a small disadvantage: having little initial kinetic energy when the projectile leaves the barrel of the gun. This makes it inaccurate at short distances. However, it is compact enough to be transported in large quantities."

      STR_SMOKE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This American manufactured grenade dates from the

        end of the WW2, is used as a signaling device, a target or landing zone
        marking device. This particular model deploys a white smoke curtain and
        can be used to cover the movement of allied units, disperse civilians or
        block the enemy's line of fire. "
      STR_FLASHBANG_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Non-lethal grenade of British origin, it is

        produced almost exclusively for the Special Air Service.  It is used to
        confuse, disorient, or distract a potential threat. The mixture of
        substances created when activated causes a chemical reaction that
        manifests itself in a very intense light and a very loud sound that can
        even stun the enemy. It explodes as soon as it comes into contact with
        the ground. It reduces TUs, Accuracy, Reactions and Stamina, as well as
        stuns the affected target."
      STR_ELECTRO_FLARE_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device produces a bright flare light

        when it is lit. This will highlight enemy units in the vicinity of the
        flare during night time missions."
      STR_STONER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Modified version of the modular rifle created by

        Eugene Stoner, it fires {ALT}7.62x51mm NATO{ALT} caliber ammunition as
        it is the most accessible to our arsenal. A bit heavy for an assault
        rifle, but undoubtedly effective. All the versions of this weapon system
        employed by us {ALT}fire the same cartridge.{ALT}"
      STR_STONER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "Variant focused on the mobility of the soldier who

        carries it, this carbine has a reduced barrel size and the stock
        removed. The disadvantage is a {ALT}reduction in accuracy and effective
        range{ALT}, but it is compensated by the {ALT}weight decrease.{ALT}"
      STR_STONER_AUTOMATIC_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Variant of the Stoner rifle focused on

        automatic and accurate fire. The heavy barrel and bipod provide
        {ALT}unprecedented accuracy{ALT}, as well as an accuracy bonus when
        firing from a {ALT}kneeling position{ALT}. Its major disadvantage is its
        limited ammunition capacity, which is quickly depleted by sustained
        fire."
      STR_STONER_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA: "This variant is similar to the one used by the US

        Navy SEALs, designed to be used as a squad automatic weapon and provide
        cover fire. It is quite {ALT}accurate{ALT} for an LMG and the
        {ALT}belt-fed capability{ALT} is a great advantage."
      STR_STONER_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: "Variant designed for {ALT}long range combat{ALT},

        with a long barrel and a precision sight with x6 magnification. As an
        additional feature, a modified stock was added (to facilitate
        ergonomics) and it was configured to fire in {ALT}semi-automatic mode
        only.{ALT}"

      STR_BREAD: "Bread"

      STR_BREAD_UFOPEDIA: "A pretty regular piece of bread, it's enough to calm the hungry, the morale and even a bit of health."

      STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_RESEARCH_1_UFOPEDIA: The complete analysis on this new type of alien weapons has been finished. With this data and the interrogations made to enemy engineers, we have discovered that these weapons are clearly of animal origin, of an aquatic species. Some of these are living beings, but the vast majority are shells and claws of what appear to be crustaceans.

      STR_FUSION_WEAPONS_RESEARCH_2_UFOPEDIA: They are incredibly resistant to heat and high pressure, so we believe that the animals from which these artifacts come are incredibly tough. The brutal energy discharge from these weapons makes them terrifying, it's as if every alien soldier is armed with a powerful rocket launcher. The energy released seems to be controlled and focused on a certain area.

      STR_INITIAL_FUSION_CELLS_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: Bio-Fusion weapons use a very interesting source of power. We have no record of anything similar in our research, which leads us to believe that aliens are constantly improving their technology to stay one step ahead of us. The texture of these batteries (if you can call them that) is viscous and their smell is foul. It stores a lot of energy with unprecedented efficiency, which can be harvested to obtain raw Elerium. A real mystery.

      STR_ALIEN_CEPHALOPOD_TISSUE_UFOPEDIA: The partially rotten carcasses of the Fusion weapon remains are essentially alien crab and squid corpses, cobbled together around a miniature reactor. The incredible resistance of the biological structure allow the weapons to withstand the huge surges of power when used with Alien Alloys used to support and make wielding surfaces (like stocks, handguards and triggers). We can reuse them with relative ease, as they are strickling similar to Earth's biological fauna - which we have abundant theory -.

      STR_HUMAN_FUSION_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The most powerful handheld weapon available to our forces, capable of obliterating both alien infantry and armor with ease. Due our inability to replicate the process of bio-fusion, these weapons are built from captured alien weaponry. Several parts have been modified to make them suitable for field operation by our forces. The alloy casing is not only meant to make the weapon light enough to be man-portable, but to also protect the user and their squad in the case of a catastrophic malfunction.

      STR_FUSION_HANDGUN_UFOPEDIA: The Fusion Handgun is a lightweight, compact weapon made of a material equally resistant to Alien Alloys, but of unknown origin. It can fire energy projectiles at high speed and appears to be our enemy's new secondary weapon. Its devastating effect is surprising for its size.

      STR_FUSION_SMG_UFOPEDIA: Powerful assault weapon, in concept it is similar to our sub-machine guns. It's quite bulky, but surprisingly light when carried, suggesting that it's used for quick and sneak attacks. Its lethality lies in its ability to saturate an area with small fusion explosions, obliterating any unprotected living creature in its range.

      STR_FUSION_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: This is a new, robust and powerful battle rifle. For some strange reason, its firing mechanism limits it to semi-automatic fire, which is a relief for our troops. It's not very accurate, perhaps because of the material it's made of. But it is precisely this material that allows it to be used in close combat, like a mallet or a club.

      STR_FUSION_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: Fearsome long-range weapon. Judging by our analysis in combat, it is difficult to use (it is rarely fired in the course of battle) because of its considerable weight, but it is compensated for by its terrifying accuracy. The design and functionality is very reminiscent of an anti-tank rifle, similar to those used in WW2. Perhaps the designers' intention was to use it to disable our vehicles.

      STR_FUSION_SPLITTER_UFOPEDIA: A large yet light alien close combat weapon, its used as a shotgun to clear human fortified positions and urban zones. The most fearsome characteristic of this weapon, its the claw-like protrude on the front of the weapon. Similar to crab or ant claws, it closes quickly and is able to amputate limbs of humans with ease.

      STR_FUSION_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: It seems a squid-like creature was surgically attached to a large structure made of Alien Alloys. While this may be an unusual configuration, even unwieldy, this weapon projects a large and wide Fusion energy beam able to penetrate thick layers of titanium in a matter of seconds. The large stress on the alien squid-like creature kills it after approximately 10 uses.

      STR_ETHEREAL_NOBLE_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: An ancient relic from a distant past, used by the Ethereal equivalent of our knights and lords. It's an extremely rare item used just by the very best soldiers in the enemy's army. It's use is not longer restricted to Ethereals only, but they are the only ones able to make them and bestow them on their new users. It channels the psi-force of the wielder to bolster the damage of the attack.

      STR_THERMONUCLEAR_PROJECTILE_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: Perhaps one of the most destructive weapons on the alien arsenal, this siege weapon is designed to obliterate fortifications with pinpoint accuracy. It's roughly the equivalent of our tactical nuclear launchers (like the M29 Davy Crockett), but with the unique ability of focusing all the Elerium Fusion energy blast into a very small area.

      STR_TEXAN_UFO_UFOPEDIA: Old turboprop aircraft created in 1935, recognized worldwide as a stable and reliable aircraft. Often used as a training and light attack aircraft, it is incredibly popular. Terrorists often steal them from civilian airfields and equip them with black market weapons for use in their missions.

      STR_MAGISTER_UFO_UFOPEDIA: Advanced training plane, built in France. It is often used as a ground attack plane and has seen action in various conflicts, both on the government force and on the rebel side. Terrorists have purchased Sidewinder missiles on the black market and are equipping them at Magister on intercept missions.

      STR_MI8_TERRORIST_UFO_UFOPEDIA: One of the most widely used helicopters in the world, the Mi-8s we face were supplied to our enemies by Superpowers, secret agencies, rebel countries or simply stolen from government hangars. It has short-range defensive weapons and can transport large numbers of troops.

      STR_MI8_UFO_UFOPEDIA: One of the most widely used helicopters in the world, the Mi-8s we face were supplied to our enemies by Superpowers, secret agencies, rebel countries or simply stolen from government hangars. It has short-range defensive weapons and can transport large numbers of troops.

#      STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Applying the nano-scale alloy manufacturing process towards power cell technology has placed the research team on the cusp of producing viable directed-energy weapons. With energy constraints removed, the research team expanded on a novel laser weapon technology previously in development in multiple countries during the early 1960s. Initial application will be in interceptor weaponry, with miniaturization of the technology for use in small arms possible later with refinement of the design and construction process

      STR_PEACEMAKER_UFOPEDIA: "A feat of ingenuity in desperate situations. Our experimental Laser-1 (XL-1) rifle is a special adaptation of alien technology. It has a damage output similar to the Alien Laser Rifle we used as the basis for building ours, although it draws more energy from our Energy Reserve than weapons built by the World Powers. Dubbed the 'Peacemaker' by our engineers, we think the name is very appropriate."

      STR_M1972_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: A laser powered handgun designed and developed by UNEXCOM and US scientists in 1972. Not only is this the first laser gun put into service, it is one of the best sidearms available to UNEXCOM forces.

      STR_38_LASER_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: An American heavy laser sidearm for soldiers who feel the need to compensate for the M1972's lack of firepower. Although Heavier than most laser sidearms, it can be useful when going up against more powerful aliens.

      STR_CALBR_UFOPEDIA: The Colt Advanced Laser Battle Rifle is a high power laser rifle made by Colt's Manufacturing Company. This semiautomatic weapon fires a powerful laser beam at the pull of a trigger. The CALBR's high accuracy and power makes it a good mid to long range weapon.

      STR_M20_M203_LASER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: The M20 is an American laser assault carbine based on the widely used M16. Created as a replacement for the outdated ballistic weapon, this laser share many of the same characteristics. This weapon is very accurate, lightweight, but suffers in Firepower. This variant utilizes an underbarrel grenade launcher.

      STR_M5_LASER_SMG_UFOPEDIA: The M5 is America's new laser submachine gun, developed after making a breakthrough in laser technology. The M5 has a higher rate of fire than any other laser weapon due to it's advanced cycling emitter banks. Although this weapon excels in close combat, it suffers at range and stray beams can become an issue.

      STR_ULYSSES_LASER_SNIPER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Ulysses is a long range laser available to UNEXCOM marksmen. The advantages of this rifle are it's ease of use and its integrated advanced scope. Although this is the least powerful Sniper available to our forces, the impressive scope has faster target acquisition allowing for more follow up shots. This weapon is useful for picking off weaker targets at long ranges.

      STR_X4_LASER_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: A laser 'shotgun' developed when an American researcher accidentally shattered a focusing optic during rifle testing, sending several small laser beams flying across the room. Although this incident at first created panic, the scientists later reasoned they could create a laser shotgun for close combat, something previously not thought possible. This laser uses an array of small mirrors to spread the lasers in several directions.

      STR_M4_LASER_LMG_UFOPEDIA: The M4 is Squad Automatic Weapon developed by DARPA and UNEXCOM to replace the suddenly outdated M-60. Although it's a bit heavy and unwieldy, the M4 is a reliable machine gun and rather accurate.

      STR_ELERIUM_FLAMETHROWER_UFOPEDIA: After the discovery of Element 115 was made available to the American government, Pentagon officials asked if the element could be used to create a powerful incendiary weapon. By fusing Elerium with Napalm, they were able to create the fuel mixture used by the X55. They discovered that the powerful incendiary mixture could burn even the toughest aliens as well as force them out of hiding spots, but that it could also pose a threat to our own, as well as civilians, if we're not careful. They reluctantly put the weapon into service, with a warning to the soldiers using them.

      STR_P71_LASER_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: Although several different nations suggested designs for a new standard NATO sidearm, Beretta's P-71 would be the only one adopted. With no need for an external power source or reloading and fine tuned for accuracy, the P-71 represents the next stage in human technology.

      STR_FN_FLA_LASER_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The FN FLA is the laser derivative of the famous FN FAL. Although the design and size are similar, the FLA is much more powerful and does not require reloading. This laser was made to provide a weapon for soldiers who desired higher accuracy and power at the cost of rate of fire.

      STR_FN_FLA_LASER_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: A smaller and lighter version of the FN FLA laser rifle, meant for airborne and light infantry troops. It includes a collapsible stock and shorter barrel. Better for close combat but lacks the range and accuracy of the Leopold Battle Rifle.

      STR_L4_ASSAULT_LASER_UFOPEDIA: The L-44 Assault Rifle is an experimental West German Assault Laser submitted to the NATO Advanced Laser Weapon Project by Heckler and Koch. At first mocked for its strange design and uncomfortable grip, the L-4 would eventually impress even the greatest skeptics with its high accuracy and light weight. Eventually UNEXCOM officials approved the design for combat.

      STR_MAT72_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA: French laser submachine gun developed and supplied by the French weapons manufacturer, Nexter Systems, uses smaller heat sinks than a typical laser rifle, so power input is reduced to avoid overheating. Still, this submachine gun is great for counter terror operations and close combat.

      STR_CHURCHILL_MARKSMAN_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: A Laser Sniper of British origin. Unlike their Soviet and American counterparts, British engineers, with the help of our scientists, were able to retain the full power of the laser as well as the accuracy. The Churchill can cut through enemies from far away, but its weight prevents quick relocation. Named after late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

      STR_ML73_LASER_MACHINE_GUN_UFOPEDIA: A West German Laser Machine Gun designed by Heckler & Koch. By late 1972 new techniques and technology allowed for larger and more efficient weapons. By converting some of the thermal energy made by firing the gun back into electrical energy, the ML-73 is able to fire large laser beams at a steady rate.

      STR_M72_AUTOMATIC_RECOILLESS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: An American 40mm recoilless rifle that combines old and new technology, used both by the US and NATO. The 'Teddy' is capable of firing 6 rounds without reloading and fires both anti infantry and anti tank munitions. Named after US president Theodore Roosevelt.

      STR_P72_COMPACT_LASER_UFOPEDIA: The P-72 was the first successful Soviet application of laser weapons technology. Small and powerful, the P-72 makes for a good sidearm, but lags behind in accuracy. The iconic white and silver color scheme, which began with this gun, would become the standard for the new generation of Soviet Weaponry.

      STR_ALK72_LASER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The backbone of the Red Army and integral in the war against the alien threat, the ALK-72 is one of the first laser assault rifles ever made. After pulsed laser fire was proven to be possible, a new weapon to replace the AK-47 was quickly designed by Markov Kharitonov. The heavy assault weapon was able to quickly prove its worth in the battle against the aliens, being both cheap and powerful, although some soldiers have complained about its less than favorable accuracy and weight.

      STR_KHARITONOV_LASER_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: UNEXCOM officers expressed the need for a weapon that bridges the gap between the ALK-72 and the Mironov Sniper Rifle, and the Kharitonov is what the engineers came up with. This weapon is capable of delivering a powerful beam over medium to long distances without sacrificing power or closer combat abilities. Named after the lead designer, Markov Kharitonov.

      STR_ALP_SUBMACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA: This iconic Laser submachine gun was designed by famed Russian laser scientist, Michael Artemiy, and was personally approved by the Soviet Minister of Defense, Andrei Grechko. Its balance in design, favoring no one aspect over any other, makes it one of the most versatile weapons among UNEXCOM soldiers.

      STR_MIRINOV_LASER_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: Laser Sniper weapon from the minds of the Soviet Red Army. Early laser technology suffered in accuracy, due to weaker optics and high power output. After advancements in focusing optics and toning down the power output, Ukrainian General Peter Mironov was able to design an accurate long-range rifle, although it suffers somewhat in damage output.

      STR_AN_MACHINE_LASER_UFOPEDIA: A Heavy Soviet machine gun developed in cooperation with the Red Army in 1972. It can reliably deliver a lot of damage in a short amount of time, but is heavier than most machine guns.

      STR_AFINA_ANTITANK_LASER_UFOPEDIA: An anti-tank laser put into service in late 1973. It is named after the Greek Goddess of Wisdom and War, Athena. The Afina was created in response to the threat posed by Cyberdiscs to UNEXCOM forces. By using all of the advancements made in laser technology in 1972, this powerful anti-tank weapon can penetrate some of the heaviest armor, short of UFO outer walls. If you can overcome the weight and the time it takes to aim and fire, the Afina is one of the greatest assets to our cause.


      STR_POWER_RESERVES_UFOPEDIA: "Each UNEXCOM soldier carries a small powercell as a part of their equipment, which is used to power electronic equipment, such as laser weaponry, in the field. These powercells are recharged once a soldier returns from a mission, though they can be recharged during a operation by using a battery if it proves necessary."

      STR_BATTERY_UFOPAEDIA: "This battery holds enough power to recharge the powercell of our soldiers attires fully. It is heavy, but might prove necessary on longer missions. The battery is automatically recharged when returned to the base"

      STR_ELERIUM_BATTERY_UFOPAEDIA: "This battery is extremely similar to the power cells of Alien Fusion weaponry, granting it twice the capacity of our regular batteries while being the same weight"

      STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE_MAG: "Hurrikan Egewehr Battery (x10)"
      STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "Developed by a joint Anglo-German R&D team from the heavy and cumbersome Sturm electric cannon of the early 60s, the 'Hurricane' includes a powerful energy generator able to project a lightning discharge at mid range, able to fry enemy automated attackers with ease over a wide area. The downside is the limited battery supply, as each discharge severely depletes it."
      STR_ELECTRIC_RIFLE_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The most difficult obstacle was the limited energy charge stored by the Mk.II lithium batteries used by the Stum Ekanone. A couple of discharges were enough to deplete the battery. The lightning barely disabled a standard Warsaw Pact armored vehicle, let alone an alien mechanized unit. Improvements and a major rework led to thr implementation of Mk.VII magnesium power cells, with the possibility of storing and transferring twice the energy of the previous designs."

      STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_MAG: "Ferromagnetic 8mm Mag (x15)"
      STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A successor of the Vikhr EMR, the 'Storm' Electromagnetic Rifle features a heavy barrel with reinforced coils, learning from the experience of having melted bbarrel due the extreme amount of energy emitted by firing the gun continuously. The size and weight were increased, but the recoil felt by the operation is barely noticed. Chambered in special ferromagnetic 8mm rounds able to pierce enemy armor. "
      STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The 2K66V Tungsten Carbide/Aluminum 8mm Ferromagnetic Slug is the experimental ammunition for the Soviet 'Gauss' weapons. The aluminum casing allows the electric current to propel the ammo to extreme speeds. Compared to the previous heavier and more expensive 2K53C 10mm TC/Copper slugs developed in 1959 (and successfully used against Mechtoid units in the Battle of Havana), the density and terminal velocity of the round and were reduced to prevent significant wear to the barrel and the coils; several Vikhr EMRs had their barrels white-hot, almost melting, at the end of the battle.

      #STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA_1: The capture and interrogation of the alien engineer allowed researchers to finally break the lock-out technology on their weapons and fully explore the design of the alien plasma weapons. Each weapon ionizes a small pellet of Alien Alloys and uses a linear accelerator to fire the superheated metal at a target. Cultured living cells from the captured alien will have to be built into re-purposed/captured weapons in order to use the weapons, while newly constructed plasma weapons will not require this bypass.

      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The capture and subsequent interrogation of the alien engineer finally unveiled the uncanny mechanics behind the plasma weapons; a powerful particle generator ionizes and propels a super hot Alien Alloys pellet, which is channeled towards the target using magnetic induction. Basically a molten metal slug guided by a magnetic field. The direct replication of the technology seems next to imposible and our limited funding prevents us to further investigate this particular topic. However, based on our research notes, we could support the World Powers' research projects working on reverse- engineering the Plasma tech and applying it into human-made assets. It's a secret hard to crack, but there's nothing our unified investigation efforts cannot accomplish."

      STR_ALIEN_COMMUNICATION_UFOPEDIA: The method of communication between alien ships seems to be a simple star style network, with each UFO communicating back with some sort of central base along a dual band microwave channel.  While the captured alien navigator provided researchers with information on the digital communication schema, decrypting the messages seems nearly impossible due to an encryption system similar to a 'one-time-pad'. Artifacts gained from a raid on an alien base may provide the UNEXCOM team with the knowledge needed to fully decrypt this communications.

      STR_HYPER_WAVE_ENCODER_UFOPEDIA: With the encryption device captured from the alien base, researchers have broken the encryption used by enemy forces.  With additional research, a new facility for intercepting alien transmissions can be constructed.

      STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA: With all the details now known of the alien microwave communication protocol, researchers have produced plans for a facility that can intercept all alien communications from alien crafts within nearly a 2500 mile radius. Translators should be able to provide information on the type of UFO, the alien race and specific activity.

      STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: This lightweight plasma PDW is the sidearm fielded by the alien forces. The weapons retrieved from the battlefield have a tamper-proof friend-or-foe lock on it that we cannot seem to circumvent, and disassembly activates a process that renders the internals of the weapon to slag. Capture of an alien engineer may allow the research team to discover methods to bypass this lock.

      STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The alien plasma rifle is the main weapon platform for the aliens and can be found on a majority of their armed forces.  Like the other alien weapons, it seems to have a lock-out of some sort that prevents soldiers from simply picking up and using it and disassembly activates a self-destruct module in it.  Interrogation of a living alien engineer may provide the information needed to bypass this lock-out technology.

      STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: While alien heavy plasma weapon is the most powerful of the alien plasma weaponry, the weapon's relative inaccuracy and slow rate of fire limits its usefulness. As with the other alien plasma weapons, it is protected with a lock-out feature, capture of an alien engineer may allow the research team to discover methods to bypass this lock.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: Due to the complexities of adding auto-fire to such a small weapon, the technique and methodology for producing a plasma pistol with the capabilities of the alien's weapon is beyond our reach. However, the research conducted on the weapon now allows engineers to modify and add interfaces familiar to our soldiers to any captured alien plasma pistols.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: Using the information and cells gleaned from the captured engineer, researchers provided the manufacturing teams plans on how to modify captured plasma rifles to work for X-com forces, with a configuration familiar to the soldiers. Additionally, not bound by the size constraints of the plasma pistol, research can be expanded to discover how to manufacture new plasma rifles.

      STR_HUMAN_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: As the heaviest of the alien plasma weapons, this weapon proved to have it's own difficulties for the design and research team.  Despite a number of promising prototypes, producing a human-built heavy plasma weapon with the same capabilities as the alien version is impossible. Despite this, conversion of captured weapons for use by the X-com team is now possible.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_MAGNUM_UFOPEDIA: Re-examining abandoned prototypes used in the failed attempts at creating new plasma pistols, the research team abandoned attempts at including auto-fire for pistol and instead concentrated on power output.  The new pistol design is analogous to the gunpowder magnum, providing more wounding energy than the .50 BMG in a one-handed weapon.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_SMG_UFOPEDIA: Combining aspects of the autofire plasma rifle and previous research done on the plasma pistol, the research team created plans for a plasma submachine gun.  While not as powerful per-shot as the plasma pistol, the flash and recoil is much more manageable and the plasma bolt retains coherency at longer ranges.

      STR_NEW_HUMAN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: Constructed completely by human hands, the manufacturing team now has plans for an exact replica of the alien plasma rifle, redesigned to meet the needs of the X-com soldiers.  Other than the missing lock-out technology, this weapon is exactly the same in capabilities as the converted alien rifles. More importantly, construction of this weapon allows for further research into human designed plasma weaponry adapted for X-com fire teams, instead of just mimicking or converting existing alien weaponry.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_DMR_UFOPEDIA: Replacing the auto-fire capability of the plasma rifle with the capability of creating heavier plasma shots and a more powerful linear accelerator, a plasma version of the designated marksman's rifle is now ready for construction.

      STR_HUMAN_SNIPER_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: Combining knowledge gained through the failed replication of the alien heavy plasma weapon and the successful duplication of the alien plasma rifle, scientists and engineers scaled up the plasma generator and concentrated on providing a more powerful linear accelerator, providing the weapon with high accuracy and massive damage potential.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_LMG_UFOPEDIA: Expanding techniques learned with the plasma submachine gun, the research team devised squad support weapon using the plasma weapon technology by scaling up the design.  Compromising on the plasma generator, it instead boasts a staggering rate of fire while mitigating flash and recoil.

      STR_HUMAN_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: This adapted launcher features the same superb handling of the alien Small Launcher and the ability to use the same ammo. We can use it against its masters to stun, capture and if needed, kill any enemy on the sight of this weapon.

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_THEORY: "Human Plasma Weapons Theory"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: "Our R&D staff continued collaborating with several military and civilian labs working to adapt the enemy's energy weapons to our needs. Now, we understand how the invaders are able to mass produce such sophisticated engineering parts in such a short time. The aliens' grow all of their materials from genetically engineered micro-organic cyberorganisms (nicknamed cybermicrobes) which they suspend in a solution containing the right ingredients, and the microbes assemble the material at the molecular level. Our science experts are astonished at the near perfect combination of organic and mechanic elements, present in most of the technology field by the aggressors. Our field experience and continued involvement with alien tech greatly augments the allied efforts"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_PROGRESS: "Human Plasma Project Progress"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_PROGRESS_UFOPEDIA: "The Command's representatives assigned to various labs working on the 'Plasma Applications Project', codename KRATOS, inform substantial advances on the theorical phase, but unexpected issues in the application phase. Privately, our scientists report certain distrust between competing research teams, as each one has managed to get different data from the very same samples. We theorized each of the three Powers have partially unlocked one of the core secrets to how the alien tech works, and through this understanding, they are able to manipulate alien tech in a way others cannot. But they won't share the knowledge with anyone else and keep it locked up as top secret military intel, perhaps motivated by political reasons. Their lack of foresight is indirectly hindering the progress and they don't even notice it. In order to avoid a diplomatic incident, our experts have returned to our HQ. Each faction need to continue their research on their own."

      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UN_APPLICATIONS: "UN Hybrid Plasma Project"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UN_APPLICATIONS_I: "UN Hybrid Plasma Project I"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UN_APPLICATIONS_I_UFOPEDIA: "The successful aplication of Alien plasma technology due the outcome of Project Kratos presented the UNEXCOM design bureau with the opportunity to design a personal weapon tailor-made for its own unique mission parameters. As an entirely air-mobile force doing the grand majority of its fighting in cramped interiors, it was decided the new weapon should be as short as possible while remaining ergonomic. For this reason a 'bullpup' layout was selected, placing the standard energy pack behind the firing grip and dramatically reducing the overall length. The next matter of importance for the team was cost. "
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UN_APPLICATIONS_II: "UN Hybrid Plasma Project II"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UN_APPLICATIONS_II_UFOPEDIA: "A Swiss materials lab was able to develop a cost-effective procedure for converting alien weapons into human-friendly, standardized firing units. These were mated to an almost entirely conventional, though modern, polymer lower assembly made by the UNEXCOM gunsmiths. For a very marginal increase in weight and cost over the previous laser rifle, it is hoped the entire force could be equipped wholesale with a single standard pattern of these new devastating 'plasma rifles' - each shot producing the power of a miniature sun - and thus save money on specialized equipment, as well as simplify supply. As each weapon is basically handcrafted by our technicians, we cannot allow ourselves to share the designs with other Powers."
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_US_APPLICATIONS: "Project Kratos: US Applications"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_US_APPLICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "American scientists working on the newly established NASA Exobiology Institute have managed to learn how to extract cybermicrobe DNA data for material production from alien artifacts, codenamed 'R.E.A.V.E.R Procedure.'. Basically, by programing the microbes you can directly define how those ensamble any kind of item; from a small pencil to high-tech targeting computer for military satellites. Combined by the advances in plasma release and contention procedures developed by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, allows the US weapon manufacturers to create highly complex particle accelerators and have limited capacity of growing alien biomaterials in the way that the aliens grow them... so more radical designs can be created and used. The major downside is prohibitive costs of each model, severely reducing the posibility of mass-producing them."
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_USSR_APPLICATIONS: "Project Kratos: Soviet Applications"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_USSR_APPLICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "We have reports of the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics has managed to accomplish something that was previously a myth of the alchemists of the past: the transmutation of materials. And more specifically, low-grade Elerium (such as the residues located at sites of alien activity since the late 50s) into refined Elerium, which is needed to power weapons and vehicles. So far, the process to refine Elerium was not clear, as the documentation collected in the last decades is reduced and the knowledge limited. By employing technology recovered from alien equipment, the Soviets managed to transmute even inert shrapnel into pure Elerium. This scientific breakthrough makes it possible to create more powerful and more efficient batteries in plasma weapons, designed by the Cherenkov Institute for Advanced Energy Projects bureau."
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_NATO_APPLICATIONS: "Project Kratos: NATO Applications"
      STR_HUMAN_PLASMA_WEAPONS_NATO_APPLICATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "The various nation members of NATO were conducting research on their own with varying degrees of success until the formation of NATO Science and Technology Centre based in NATO HQ, Brussels. The unified European research network focused on the discovery of the hybridization of human and alien tech in order to ease the replication of the latter. Recently, one of the R&D teams managed incorporate human tech with alien components, with the idea to improve the already existing designs. The initial application was a high-powered radio transmitter using Alien Entertainment device, but prototype weapons are expected to be augmented with extraterrestrial tech. With the European development, the NATO hybrid weapons are going to be cheaper and easier to manufacture. The leading European weapon firms are ready to produce energy weapons for the Treaty armed forces."


      STR_UN_PLASMA_RIFLE: "XP-2 'Peacebringer' Hybrid Plasma"
      STR_UN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A bullpup approach on the most direct application of the Alien plasma tech so far, this is a bulky yet surprisingly light battle rifle. An Alien particle generator forms the core of the weapon, with a magnifiying scope attached to a carrying handle. A small, removable battery provides backup energy to the electronic systems, as we haven't found a reliable way to extract it from the alien battery."

      STR_US_PLASMA_RIFLE: "XM590 Plasma Battle Rifle"
      STR_US_PLASMA_RIFLE_MAG: "P-EC1 Plasma BR Cell (x30)"
      STR_US_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The XM590 had its outer furnishing be based on Eugene Stoner's rifle designs, to make adoption easier by the regular infantryman. However the internals have little in common, as it includes a MOD12-P particle accelerator. Field testers report some unexpected issues with the full auto mode, it has a tendency to deplete ammo too quickly and overheat the weapon. Nonetheless, the weapon is expected to increase the firepower of US Special Forces squads."
      STR_US_PLASMA_RIFLE_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The Battle Rifle's MOD12-P particle accelerator is powered by a Plasma-Energy Cell 1, 5 mW Elerium battery. Said battery provides enough power to energize the power source inside the weapon. The Cells are relatively easier (although not cheaper) to make, compared to other batteries of contemporary Plasma weaponry field by other Powers, using the R.E.A.V.E.R. Procedure."
      STR_US_PLASMA_SHOTGUN: "X80 Plasma Stormgun"
      STR_US_PLASMA_SHOTGUN_MAG: "X8A Plasma Stormgun Container (x5)"
      STR_US_PLASMA_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Single-shot, thermobaric projectile launcher. A top-secret chemical compound is directly fed into the particle accelerator, ejecting extremely hot gases in a wide area. Powerful enough to melt alien alloys, it poses a threat to even alien armour. However careful tactics are required to properly utilize it due to short range and unusual operating procedures."
      STR_US_PLASMA_SHOTGUN_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The highly-classified compound inside the Container used to fuel the Stormgun is the motive of much speculation among the troop. Only high-ranked engineering personnel has clearance enough to have said information. It is said it contains traces of white phosporous or Elerium-infused napalm. The only thing well known is the devastating effects on the targets.  "
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL: "FGM-77 Dragon Guided Munitions Launcher"
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL_HEAT_ROCKET: "Dragon M222 HEAT Rocket"
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL_ELERIUM_ROCKET: "Dragon XM225 Elerium Rocket"
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL_UFOPEDIA: "The guided launcher began as a heavy medium-range assault weapon developed through the decade of the 60s. Using blaster launcher tech, the rocket became wireless and gained extreme maneuverability. Capable of eliminating alien armor from miles away, bank tight corners and even take out small ufos, the weapon system is a force to be reckoned with."
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL_HEAT_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "The standard munition used by the Dragon rocket launcher is a High-Explosive, Anti-Tank shaped charge round, with the optimal 330mm armor penetrating capability. Not an extremely powerful munition, but the greatest advantage is the reverse-engineered 'BLASTER' guidance system used to follow up to 9 waypoints without losing target lock."
      STR_US_PLASMA_RL_ELERIUM_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "By modifying a standard M222 HEAT rocket with the addition of a 5 kilograms low-yield Elerium warhead, the offensive capabilities of the Dragon are greatly increased. Meant to be used in anti-fortification roles, the violent fusion reaction severly wounds any unfortunate live being near the blast zone."

      STR_NATO_PLASMA_CARBINE: "MAS-73 E1 Plasma Carbine"
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_CARBINE_MAG: "Plasma Carbine Standard Battery (x20)"
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: "Initially a project to replace the aging MAS-49 rifles, the development of Plasma tech motivated French General Paul Tellie, head of the project, to adapt their model to become an energy weapon. The bullpup design and lightweight frame made it a versatile weapon both inside ufos and in combat in terrain, with its only drawbacks being a somewhat limited ammo capacity, slightly reduced damage and range."
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_CARBINE_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The NATO researchers had a tough time trying to create an Elerium battery strong enough to power a carbine-sized firearm. The result was less than satisfactory, but with the main advantage of being cheap and fast to make. There were some concerns of the security measures in the manufacturing of the 4 mW Elerium Standard Battery, but so far there are not accidents reported."
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_PISTOL: "Enfield APEX Plasma Pistol"
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_PISTOL_MAG: "Plasma Pistol Compact Battery (x12)"
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "'Advanced Pistol, Energy, eXperimental', a compact-yet-surprisingly heavy handgun made by RSAF Enfield. The design bureau was tasked to develop a very powerful sidearm for offensive purposes, meant to be used by assault squads. The recoil feels similary to a regular combat revolver, but with greatly increased damage capabilities. The pistol includes a quick battery-ejecting mechanism."
      STR_NATO_PLASMA_PISTOL_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield worked directly with the physics specialists at NATO Science and Technology Centre to create the most compact-yet-efficient Elerium battery as possible, in an effort to miniaturize the particle accelerator without losing stopping power. The main idea in RSAF was creating a 'hand cannon', a trustworthy sidearm but very powerful, as the enemy is deploying more and more armored units, and rear echeleon and support units were often outgunned."
      STR_NATO_SNIPER_PLASMA: "Walther L/Pl-SG 200 Sniper Plasma"
      STR_NATO_SNIPER_PLASMA_MAG: "Sniper Plasma Heavy Battery (x6)"
      STR_NATO_SNIPER_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "A high quality semi-automatic sniper rifle, with a bullpup configuration to make room for a larger particle accelerator and barrel. The initial design was made after the failed Munich Olympics terror attack that nearly cost the lives of the Israeli delegation. The need of a powerful precision rifle with pin-point accuracy was latent until the development of hybrid plasma weaponry. Lacks iron sights, instead it uses a fixed x8 optical sight."
      STR_NATO_SNIPER_PLASMA_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "We could consider these finely-crafted 7 mW Elerium Heavy Batteries another staple of the German engineering feats. Even when European plasma developments are directed as being 'lighter, cheaper, efficient', the West Germans had put an extra amount of work to create an above-average energy cell to power their long gun. No less level of quality could be accepted into such promising sniper rifle. "

      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_ASSAULT_RIFLE: "APVCh Plasma Assault Rifle"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG: "Plasma Assault Optimal Elerium Cell (x35)"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_ASSAULT_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Avtomatichyeskaya Plazmyemmaya Vintovka Chyeryenkova' is a sturdy automatic rifle designed by the Cherenkov Institute for Advanced Energy Projects. The accelerator is reinforced and the wooden furniture is specifically treated to resist high temperatures. The frame is strong enough to withstand lots of physical punishment without compromising the power source, theorically allowing an infantryman to engage in melee."
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_ASSAULT_RIFLE_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The Soviet scientist working for the Cherenkov Institute had some doubts of adding a very powerful (and a bit inestable) Elerium cell for the next main infantry rifle of the Warsaw Pact. So they underwent a series of redesings and reworks until they came with a decently protected battery. The only concern is the fact their rifle's frame is strong enough to be used as a club to melee enemies, but the still delicate Elerium containers may be compromised with fatal results."
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_SMG: "PShAB Plasma PDW"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_SMG_MAG: "Plasma PDW Miniaturized Elerium Cell (x25)"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_SMG_UFOPEDIA: "'Plazmyenniy Shturmovoy Avtomat Budkyer', the only Plasma weapon designed by the Budker Nuclear Institute and made by Tula Arms Plant. The compact submachine gun features a special wire stock with arm support, used to increase the stability of the weapon used by one-hand only. The hard-hitting plasma bolts are shot at decent ROF. The small Elerium battery limits the prolongated use."
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_SMG_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The size and weigh constrains limited the Budker Institute weaponry bureau to develop a larger Elerium cell to power their submachine gun. A compromise was made to reduce the rate of fire of the PShAb gun and keep the quality of the power cells, to increase the total amount of plasma discharges. Still, the large energy output of the transmuted Elerium makes the Budker submachine gun a competent support weapon."
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_LMG: "PPCh Plasma MG"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_LMG_MAG: "Plasma MG High-Density Elerium Cell (x50)"
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_LMG_UFOPEDIA: "A heavy squad automatic weapon, the 'Pulyemyet Plazmyenniy Chyeryenkova' features a large barrel shroud with the purpose of quickly cooling down after sustained plasma discharges. High-powered energy bolts are able to rip apart lightly armored enemies with ease. Field testers argued about the weight of the weapon and the size, as it makes it somewhat cumbersome."
      STR_SOVIET_PLASMA_LMG_MAG_UFOPEDIA: "The Cherenkov Energy Institute scientists were very proud of this particular model of Elerium Cell. By transmuting a large amount of inert Elerium shards into a pure element again, it was possible to fill as much as possible... again, with the latent risk of a contention failure in case of a strong physical impact. Machine Gunners trained with the PPCh are taught to keep their 9 mW cells in special armored cases, to avoid an accident."

      STR_CEREBREAL_UFOPAEDIA: "Cerebreals are a race that is not fully integrated into the alien hive-like society; they are more like allies, who agreed to serve the invaders for some unfathomable reasons.  They bear incredibly strong psionic powers, which can be focused as a weapon:  a violent discharge of plasma, fuelled by will alone.  Their independent and completely alien pattern of thinking make them unpredictable, but also more prone to panic than other alien races."

      STR_CEREBREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This specimen are not your typical alien race: its genetics are completely different to both Earth and most alien species, and it seems even stranger than most other types of alien life.  Most of its body mass is neural matter, and the rest is almost exclusively advanced cybernetics to keep this enormous 'brain' running.  It seems unable to use hand weapons, and it has no significant natural means of defense.  There is little else we can say about this terrifying creature."

      STR_CEREBREAL_LARVA_UFOPAEDIA: "This creature is a young form of a Cerebreal, encased in a tiny UFO-like vehicle for protection on the battlefield.  While not as potent as an adult Cerebreal, it's still a formidable monster, with high intelligence and notable psionic resilience.  Its vessel is equipped with a deadly plasma weapon."

      STR_CEREBREAL_LARVA_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This creature is almost entirely composed of brain tissue, encased in a hovering capsule.  This capsule is quite resilient to damage, especially bullets and laser beams.  It also features a plasma weapon, which is similar in profile to the Plasma Rifle."

      STR_CHTONITE_UFOPAEDIA: "Chtonites are a sturdy alien race, very well suited for menial work and harsh environmental conditions.  They prefer to live in underground compounds and would be harmed by sunlight, if not for their ocular implants.  Their intelligence is average, but they are more than capable of waging a war against mankind."

      STR_CHTONITE_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This alien has a strong and resilient body, but is otherwise quite similar to us.  Its thick skin gives it a good protection against bullets and blades alike.  Its eyes are protected by a pair of cybernetic 'goggles', which seem to enhance its vision as well as protect the eyes."

      STR_TUNLUN_UFOPAEDIA: "Tunluns burrow through the earth by spitting acid to corrode rocks for digestion, then shovel it aside with their flipper-like limbs. They are used by the Chtonites as living burrowing machines to build outposts and bases on Earth.  However, their acidic spit makes them perfect terror weapons as well.  Luckily, their overall intelligence is well below human."

      STR_TUNLUN_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: "This peculiar alien has a very small brain for a sentient creature, which suggests low intelligence.  It is equipped with a large tube for a mouth, which produces large amounts of highly corrosive substance that can be propelled and therefore used as a weapon.  Its skin is very tough and extremely difficult to puncture, as well as virtually immune to the creature's own acid."

      STR_REPTOID_UFOPAEDIA: Reptoids have been on Earth for quite a while, long before the invasion began.  Despite their bestial appearance, they possess extraordinary intelligence, which makes them excellent spies and field agents.  There is not much we can say about their origins, but their long history on Earth and their genetic closeness to ourselves point to a terrestrial genesis.  Nonetheless, their loyalty to aliens is absolute.

      STR_REPTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: This creature is covered with tough scales, able to withstand small caliber bullets with ease.  Curiously, despite its reptilian appearance, it seems to be quite resistant to heat.  Its brain is highly developed, suggesting a possibly superhuman intelligence.  Its most interesting feature however is their DNA, which is either terrestrial in origin or modelled after Earth creatures.

      STR_SALAMANDRON_UFOPAEDIA: The Salamandron is a frightening beast, vaguely resembling ancient predators but also quite different.  Designed solely for terror, it is equipped with incendiary rockets, able to lay waste to a small town within minutes.  Its behavior can regulated by a set of small receivers implanted into its brain, but it largely operates on its own, making it difficult to control but also virtually invulnerable to jamming.

      STR_SALAMANDRON_AUTOPSY_UFOPAEDIA: This creature is very sturdy, covered with thick scales and extremely resistant to heat, but not so much to laser cutters.  Its tiny brain features a number of small implants whose purpose seems to be provoking basic 'fight or flight' reactions within its system.
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_1_UFOPEDIA: "Since July 10, 1947, we know that there is alien life. The famous Roswell case, which was said to be a meteorological balloon, was actually a Small Scout who collided during what we believe was a reconnaissance mission. The United States government quickly secured the remains and began its investigation. These data collected, despite having more than 25 years, are useful in these moments of terror."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_3_UFOPEDIA: "In the last decade, contacts with extraterrestrial entities have begun to be more violent. On April 25, 1968, a Lufthansa commercial aircraft was shot down in mysterious conditions after disappearing from the radar, near the Alps. Authorities attributed it to a fissure in the fuselage, although military observers noticed a strange flash before the accident.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE} A similar case, but this time on American soil, occurs on October 5, 1971. A commercial TWA flight is intercepted over Massachusetts. Units of the Tactical Air Command are scrambled to engage the hostiles and an air combat takes place between four F-4 Phantom II and the UFO. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Boeing 747 and three Phantom were shot down. The UFO, despite being severely damaged, was able to escape. However, this aerial battle served to understand better the enemy that awaits us. Our surveillance systems could briefly analyze their characteristics."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_4_UFOPEDIA: "Motivated by these acts of war, on March 18, 1972 a session of the UN Security Council is called in New York. At this meeting, representatives of the world powers agreed to form a more aggressive initiative to contain the growing unknown threat. The project is called the United Nations Extraterrestrial Combat Command and should take action by autumn of the same year. Enough time to gather all the equipment, planes, weapons and necessary personnel, both civil and military, to be able to face any threat to the Earth."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_5_UFOPEDIA: "UNEXCOM has the best scientists, engineers, specialists and soldiers from different armed forces from all around the world, including army, navy and air force. We count on the support of various space agencies, such as NASA, the European Space Research Organisation and Soviet space agencies to support UNEXCOM in the astronautics and scientific fields that may be required. We have absolute clearance to overfly any country and to deploy combat missions without any restrictions, sometimes even with local support. Our motto is 'AD HONOREM. AD PERPETUA MEMORIA.

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_6_UFOPEDIA: "After the culmination of the Cuban Crisis, the Unites States and Soviet Union agreed on forming a joint investigation force to search for any signs of extra-terrestial activity. Though initially compromising only of agents from the two World Powers, the permanent members of the UN Security Council were soon invited to participate, to ensure the agency had global outreach. Dubbed the United Nations Department of Extraterrestrial Investigations, the clandestine organization established its headquarters in Vauxhall, London, though many of its agents were often covertly attached onto existing UN missions. Under the last decade, operating from the shadows, UNDETI had worked to identify and eliminate any alien operatives that they could find.  In the early days of the organization, the agency sat idle for months waiting for leads to follow, yet eventually it found itself outstretched and barely able to react to all threats it uncovers."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_7: "Reserved Intel: Careful approach"
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_7_UFOPEDIA: "Officially presenting as a protection service for UN personnel operating in hostile environments, the UN Envoy Security Service operated in actuality as the paramilitary wing of UNDETI. Dealing with targets that sole UNDETI agents can't handle trough simple subterfuge or assassinations, members of the Security Service operated in hit-squads of up to 8 soldiers strong. Often wearing unmarked uniforms , or even ones carrying the symbols of other intelligence services, the UNESS completed its missions with brutal efficiency, careful not to let any trace of their activity become known."

      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_8: "Reserved Intel: Breaking point"
      STR_UNEXCOM_HISTORY_8_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the difficulty of inducting recruits to the organization and the increase of operations it was forced to undertake, the ESS went into a steady decline. The final nail in the coffin for the organization was a mission undertook the May 18th, 1971, where contact was lost with two squads conducting a mission in a water treatment facility in Madras, India. All the agents sent to investigate found was charred corpses. The decline of the UNESS and the result of the ill-fated Madras mission led to calls for the formation of a full military unit to replace it and to better combat the looming extraterrestrial threat. This is where we take the baton. We must prevail, no matter the cost."

In 1961, on what is known today as 'Nordiska Kraschen',The Nordic Crash, a single unidentified flying object (which we now believe was a Medium Scout) was spotted throughout northern Europe, flying at incredible speed. A pair of SAAB J29F Tunnan were scrambled to engage the object and after a dogfight, was shot down. This, along with the Massachusetts event, showed that UFOs aren't invincible. The United Nations equipped us with surplus Tunnan fighters provided by the Swedish Air Force. Old, but reliable."

      STR_UNEXCOM_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The weaponry used in UNEXCOM is varied and for all tastes. Many guns overlap each other and you will find many weapons of the same type. Feel free to pick your favorite and ignore the others, most are meant to be sell if unused. You may notice that each weapon class has a different set of fire modes. Each class is meant for a purpose, some are best used in close quarters, some others are best for ranged combat. You can find a explanation of the different Special attacks on the reports below."

      STR_RIFLE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "This type of weapon is widely used by armies all around the world. Two types of rifles are used: Battle Rifles, heavier and more powerful, but difficult to fire and Assault Rifles, lighter and more accurate. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}Burst, three shots (Aimed slot). {NEWLINE}Control Auto, five shots (Auto slot)"

      STR_SPECIALIZED_WEAPONS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "The special weapons combine features of different weapon classes, like fire modes and effective ranges. As such, each weapon is grants commendations for both of the classes. Our advice is not fielding the devices as a regular rifle or shotgun - even when the name of the weapon may refer it as a regular firearm -, but deploy them in situations where highly dangerous enemies are expected (like enemy mechanized infantry or armored vehicles) {NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Unique for each weapon."

      STR_LMG_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Squad-issued automatic weapons, meant to support the troops on the battlefield. The primary function is to saturate an area with fire to keep the enemy behind cover. {NEWLINE}Special attack: {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Burst, 5 shots (Snap slot). {NEWLINE}Suppression, 10-15 shots (Auto slot)"

      STR_WEAPON_REQUISITION_UFOPEDIA: "We can request a requisition of some weapons that we find on the battlefield, used by allied troops. This is completely optional, since we have our own weapons. Once the request is processed, the weapon in question will be available in our arsenal for acquisition."

      STR_GRENADE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Explosive devices that require a steady and strong arm to be propelled into the air. Light and very useful, it is recommended to have a skilled soldier to use them properly. "

      STR_MELEE_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Melee weapons are very cheap tools, meant to be used in close combat when a weapon isn't available (either due running out of ammo or being broken). The effectiveness varies on the skill of the soldier using them, both melee and strength."

      STR_MEDICAL_ITEMS_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Healing and recovering tools and medicine, meant to patch up wounds, recover stamina and health. Having a healthy soldier means another weapon firing on the enemies, don't forget to carry enough on the battlefield."

      STR_FOOD_REPORT_UFOPEDIA: "It is said that an army marches on it stomach. Food rations, like canned meat or cigarettes, are important to keep a high morale. Read carefully the instructions on each item report to know the pros and cons of each ration."

      STR_WEAPON_MODIFICATION_UFOPEDIA: "Our gunsmiths and engineers are very skilled and are able to design and modify certain weapons to create customized variants of those. To customise a weapon, we need the weapon itself and an another part (like scopes, grenade launchers, et cetera). We can get further blueprints with the help of experts, like Special Forces operators and even Mercenaries. However, asking for the help of one faction will permanently disable the other one, choose carefully."

      STR_SPECIAL_FORCES_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Members of selected units from Security Council countries have volunteered to train our soldiers and support them in combat, if necessary. We are still negotiating the recruitment of these elite soldiers, but for now the support provided by volunteers will be more than sufficient. They have shared their modifications to their personal weapons with the R&D team in the Workshop, we can customize our weapons based on their blueprints."

      STR_MERCENARY_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Through non-official means, we have managed to contact soldiers who are members of a private military company, who have agreed to provide us with their services as military advisors, even participating in combat, if necessary. At the moment, we cannot hire them, although some volunteers will arrive at our base in a couple of days. They have provided us with several blueprints to modify weapons, which we can start producing on right now."

      STR_ON_OUR_OWN_UFOPEDIA: "We have declined the offer of entirely siding with a single World Power, in favor of neutrality. While this may pose an initial difficulty, we feel it is the option that would least affect the delicate geopolitical balance by not favoring any one faction. Instead, we have the support of the rest of the UN to equip our troops. This does not mean that we are antagonizing anyone, as we will still work side by side with all UN member countries. We can ask up to three times for a supply airdrop from the UN and one from each World Power."

      STR_UN_CUSTOM_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Our Diplomatic Liaison has secured a contact with a private defense company, which has offered to supply us with the novel (but sadly ignored) modular weapons system created by Eugene Stoner. We will be able to purchase the basic rifle pattern, as well as blueprints to adapt the weapon to our needs. It will undoubtedly enhance our flexibility in combat."

      STR_USA_INITIAL_APPROACH_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "One of our diplomatic liaisons in the United States has secured a meeting with senior military officials from various branches. This meeting has sought to obtain material support to equip our troops, yet they have refused to do so by unofficial means. But they have assured us of their support if we openly ask for American help, but only if we seek it exclusively from them. At the end of the interview, we were gifted with a Remington Combat Shotgun, designed to be equipped in elite troops. "

      STR_NATO_INITIAL_APPROACH_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Secret contacts with top European figures have brought us closer to them to try and get the material support our cause so badly needs. At the end of our meeting, we were given an SG 510-4 Carbine, informing us that this exclusive weapon could be given to our soldiers. We have been warned that European politicians and military do not like cooperation with the Soviets, so it is a fact that they will withdraw their support if we engage in official talks with the USSR. The Americans have also expressed that they'll only support us if we ask exclusively them, so they will turn away if we seek european support. "

      STR_USSR_INITIAL_APPROACH_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "Our diplomatic contacts have managed to get close to certain important figures in the USSR. We cannot reveal their names, but they have offered to assist us in soliciting support from the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union in general, if we so wish.  As a sign of good faith, they have given us an AKMSU carbine, for the exclusive use of the VDV airborne forces, a rare piece to find. However, we have been informed that Soviet politicians will not tolerate a rapprochement with NATO or the United States, so perhaps we should be careful not to lose possible open Soviet help."

      STR_USA_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Members of our diplomatic relations team have approached the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, George H.W. Bush to request American military support and equipment to arm our troops. It has taken some time, but he has agreed to provide us with the most modern equipment in the American arsenal, such as the M1911 Colt 45, M16/M203, XM117 Carbine, Remington Combat Shotgun, XM21, M79 Thumper, M72 LAW and M60. He also offered to equip our interception squadrons with USAF aircraft, but Ambassador Bush had to withdraw before continuing negotiations. We must contact him again if we want his support in the future."

      STR_USSR_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "We have spoken with the Soviet representative on the UN Security Council, Yakov Malik, to ask him for support in obtaining weapons and extra resources for our operation. After several hours of dialogue, he has agreed to provide us with first-class equipment available for the best of the Red Army. The following list of weapons is available at the Shop: Stechkin APS, AKM with bayonet, AKMSU, Skorpion vz. 68, KS-23 Heavy Shotgun, RPG7 and RPKS. To request air support from the Soviet Air Forces, our diplomatic team must continue to negotiate with Representative Malik."

      STR_NATO_SUPPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Our diplomatic team has begun talks with Joseph Luns, Secretary General of NATO. After several talks over several days, he has agreed to our request to provide us with weapons and equipment from the various nations that make up the North Atlantic Treaty. His only condition was to support the NATO countries in case of any alien aggression. We have at our disposal the most recent models of Beretta 92FS, FN FAL with shotgun, SG 510-4 Carbine, H&K MP5, H&K PSG1, Carl Gustav M2 and FN MAG. However, if we wish to obtain aircraft and weapons, we must return to dialogue with Secretary Luns once again."

Its particular arrow shape guarantees good stability in extreme flight regimes, increasing safety for pilots.  By accepting the suggestion of this light aircraft, the USSR has withdrawn the offer to equip us with heavy interceptors."

      STR_SPECIAL_FORCES_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: After a long series of diplomatic talks, we got the support of the world's best Special Forces operatives (including the American Green Berets and the British SAS) to join our cause, some have volunteered. Their experience and high training make them way superior to the project's average volunteers. Their skills are unparalleled on the battlefield, perfect to fight an unknown enemy. Their recruiting cost is very high, but it's worth it.

      STR_MERCENARY_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: We have requested once again the support of these private soldiers to increase our combat capabilities. Most are veterans of elite groups from various armies around the world, making them more combat experienced than many of our volunteers. Their skills will be especially useful to our combat operations against the alien invaders. The recruitment cost is not very high, although their salary certainly is.

      STR_SUBMARINE_WARFARE_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: Our enemy seems to come from above the skies and below the seas. The ocean has been a place of mystery and unknown since centuries ago. To prepare ourselves to fight in this environment so strange to us, we have requested modified Spearguns and frogmen swimsuits. Underwater combat is tough, our weapons will inflict less damage with the distance.

      STR_SDV_MINISUB_UFOPEDIA: SEAL Delivery Vehicle. Small sized submarine meant to be used in special operations by the US Navy SEALs. It is small enough to fit inside a cargo plane or a mothership nuclear submarine. Our troops will deploy to underwater combat zones using it, but only 8 soldiers can be deployed, 4 per SDV.

      STR_AIRDROP_SDV_UFOPEDIA: Our troopers must be ferried in Paratrooper planes only. Another allied cargo plane, sometimes even a nuclear sub, will carry our SDVs into a designed LZ, were our soldiers will paradrop and aboard the subs, navigating to the combat zone. Recovery of artifacts and our forces will be done by allied naval ships.

      STR_IMPROVED_AQUATIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Recent research made by our engineers working along allied armories have come with a solution to increase underwater firepower, by using allen alloy darts to increase the lethality of our weapons. We can select a weapon set from our allies. The USA offer us heavy equipment. The NATO will give us cheaper weapons and the USSR offer us a wide variety of weapons.

      STR_USA_IMPROVED_AQUATIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The UN Navy has developed a series of heavy weapons, to bring as much firepower as possible. A powerful torpedo launcher with guided projectiles, an improvement to the Speargun currently used and a sidearm with good ammo capacity are now available to us.

      STR_NATO_IMPROVED_AQUATIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: A series of joint projects between the British, German, French and Italian Navy Commandos, have result in very cheap, yet powerful, underwater equipment meant to be used by Commandos on special operations. This includes the brand new submarine handgun by H&K, a guided disposable torpedo and a magnetic mine with electronic timer are now available.

      STR_USSR_IMPROVED_AQUATIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The Soviet Navy has designed highly specialized weapons for their frogmen, in the form of a practical handgun, a superb assault rifle based on the Kalashnikov series and an accurate light machine gun. Those weapons are available for purchase now.

      STR_ALLOY_BALLISTIC_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Field testing had confirmed that Alien Alloys are incredibly light and hard. We have decided to use the knowledge we have to create ballistic weapons that use AA as ammunition. In addition, we have experimented on weapon designs that utilize two parallel magazines with different munitions. This innovation greatly improves tactical versatility, at the cost of reliability.  Our engineers requested permission to develop our own designs. The Council has approved our request, because gun shops around the world are focusing on creating laser weapons and we have the most AA available."

      STR_FLECHETTE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "Flechette ammunition is a little explored concept, in which small metal darts, stabilized with fins, are used. These inflict serious injuries and are extremely lightweight. Our new set of weapons, created by our engineers, uses flechettes from Alien Alloys, inside a normal ammunition casing of various calibres. Its futuristic design has pleased our troops and those of allied countries alike. While capable of inflicting horrific wounds, flechettes have extremely poor armour penetrating capabilities. They are so light that a large number of them can be transported. Simply terrifying."

      STR_DEPLETED_URANIUM_UFOPEDIA: The Council has authorized us to use the super-dense material known as tungsten carbide. This material will form the core of the bullets and will be wrapped in an alien alloy casing, compensating for the weight of the core. This tungsten carbide is super dense and very strong, combined with the speed and kinetic energy of our weapons, make the perfect combination to annihilate any type of armor."

      STR_ALLOY_CLOSE_UFOPEDIA: "After we received an urgent request from our soldiers specialized in storming UFOs (popularly known among our ranks as 'Raiders') in which they asked us for weapons specifically focused on breaking and tearing apart all enemies in close combat. Taking this into consideration, we have put special emphasis on the creation of a machine pistol as a secondary weapon, as well as various shotguns for two purposes: short and medium range. The blueprints were sent to the workshop for their manufacture."

      STR_ALLOY_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: "Rifles and carbines are the weapons par excellence of the average soldier. Our scientists have created a couple of practical weapons that are extremely adaptable to any situation. Its strength is the combat at short and medium distance. Although they can be used to shoot down more distant targets, it is not recommended. Our soldiers are very interested in equipping these weapons, we can start producing them as soon as possible."

      STR_ALLOY_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy equipment we are designing allows our troops to have specialized support on the battlefield. While rifles and pistols are more standardized weapons among our soldiers, intended for a general purpose, heavy weapons are used in situations where a rifle or carbine is not sufficient. The construction in Alien Alloys makes these weapons incredibly light, unlike their conventional equivalents. We are ready to begin manufacturing if needed."

      STR_ALLOY_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "Explosives are quite useful when one bullet is not enough. The new explosive weapons have similar concepts behind them, although with a different implementation. Whether in the form of a throwing weapon or a specialized remote weapon with an automatic fire option, explosives must be used with caution to avoid friendly fire incidents."

      STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "For more than 10 years, American and Soviet technicians have worked on creating an efficient system to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) without using interceptor missiles and also secretly combat a potential extraterrestrial threat.  The first examples were tested in 1962, in the form of the heavy, US-made China Lake Laser Gun. Each faction has focused on a particular type of laser. USA uses Helium-Neon lasers. NATO uses Alexandrite lasers and Soviet lasers use Garnet/Nd-YAG lasers. Our research notes can help world powers improve their designs, which will be provided to us upon request."

      STR_HYBRID_LASER_PROJECT_UFOPEDIA: "During the 1960s, a joint US and USSR secret project developed laser weaponry based on samples of unknown technology collected between 1961 and 1963. This is not publicly available information, but our contacts in the governments of both powers have made this known to us. It is not possible for us to acquire laser weapons - due to our neutrality policies - but using the notes of our R&D staff, as well as American and Soviet researchers, we have designed an adaptation of the laser rifle employed by the aliens. It requires a lot of energy, but it is also more powerful than the equivalent of the other nations."

      STR_SECRET_CRISIS_PROTOTYPES: "Secret Crisis Experimental Weapons"
      STR_SECRET_CRISIS_PROTOTYPES_UFOPEDIA: "While we're unable to directly acquire high tech weaponry from the World Powers, we aren't forbidden to contact our friends in high places. Thanks to the Commander's connections in the various intelligence services like MI6, BND and D17, we're able to secure prototypes developed as side projects by the original R&D teams who worked back in the Secret War to outgun and outsmart the invaders. They had most of their funding cut out due the relocation of assets towards the laser weapons developed by the major defense contractors, so they had to conduct their research mostly paid by their own pockets. The results are greatly specialized weapons, but almost handmade. We were given the blueprints by our friends in the services, now we can start producing those in our gunsmiths."

      STR_USA_LASER_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: American laser weapons are balanced in terms of power and mobility. By employing Helium-Neon power cells, the laser beam released is consistent and powerful. To avoid overheating the weapon, liquid nitrogen is used and the crystals employed are calibrated to release the energy in the form of pulses, allowing for higher rates of fire without compromising the firing system.  The structure of the weapon is solid and does not require much maintenance.

      STR_USA_LASER_HANDGUNS_UFOPEDIA: The handheld laser weapons created for the U.S. armed forces are characterized by their power and compactness, although a little heavier than their Soviet and European counterparts. Based on the reliability and performance of the legendary M1911 Colt 45, American engineers have managed to reduce the size of the refractor crystals without altering their firepower.

      STR_USA_LASER_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: The U.S.-designed laser rifles have the iconic silhouette of the M16, in service with U.S. troops. The carrying handle used on the Armalite family of rifles is the same on this new generation of assault weapons. With a focus on fast, accurate fire, the new weapons for the American soldier are designed so that an experienced M16 marksman will have no trouble getting used to the new M20 or CALBR.

      STR_USA_LASER_CLOSE_RANGE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The United States has learned its lesson in the Vietnam War. The assault rifles employed by the MACV troops performed less well than expected in close quarters fighting in the jungle. To compensate for this, the new short-range weapons are specially designed to saturate an area with a lot of firepower, denying the enemy the possibility of getting close to the soldier using them. We are confident that these new weapons will be useful to soldiers who assault a UFO or an alien base.

      STR_USA_LASER_HEAVY_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "American tactical doctrine assigns heavy weapons to infantry platoons to provide cover or long-range fire. These new support weapons are focused on suppressing the enemy's combat capability, although by their nature, they are quite uncomfortable to use and transport. It is recommended that soldiers who use them maintain fixed and stable positions, and that they do not compromise their bodily integrity when using this new laser weaponry."

      STR_NATO_LASER_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: Research over the past ten years, using the knowledge gained in the 1961-1963 Crisis, has resulted in the use of Alexandrite lasers and the development of a range of light and accurate weaponry. The Alexandrite crystal is not exactly the most powerful, although it does prevent the light beam from being widely dispersed. NATO has submitted the 'NATO Advanced Laser Weapon Project' to get support from the European countries to create the wide set of weapons that will be required on the War against the aliens.

      STR_NATO_LASER_HANDGUNS_UFOPEDIA: The handheld laser weaponry project that won the NATO tender was presented by the Italian firm Beretta. Their proposal includes a fast and accurate laser weapon, designed for medium range shooting. NATO officers are particularly pleased and many have adopted it as a secondary weapon.

      STR_NATO_LASER_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: At the time NATO requested the NATO Advanced Laser Weapon Project, only two armouries prevailed - Heckler & Koch and FN Herstal. Their standard infantry weapons models prevailed over the other competitors and the fight was so close that the evaluation committee could not decide on either the L-4 or the FLA, so both entered service.

      STR_NATO_LASER_CLOSE_RANGE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The current NATO doctrine favors the mobility of troops to face threats to the territories of member countries, moving away from fighting in fixed locations. The laser sub-machine gun of French origin chosen to equip the European troops is so light that a soldier can run with it and practically not notice it. It is expected to be well received among airborne troops.

      STR_NATO_LASER_HEAVY_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: An important section in the NATO Advanced Laser Weapon Project program consisted of a wide range of heavy and support weapons. Among the winning projects were a powerful British precision rifle, a German machine gun and artillery co-created with the USA. Its function is to complement and enhance the firepower of every European brigade.

      STR_USSR_LASER_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: Using information gathered since 1963, the Soviets have been able to slowly create a variety of laser weaponry employing Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) technology, developed by the Experimental Weapons Design Committee, led by the General Peter Mirinov. This is an important development, since among the military applications, there is also the possibility of improving communications (the YAG laser is particularly efficient in this). Brute power is synonymous with lasers used by Warsaw Pact troops.

      STR_USSR_LASER_HANDGUNS_UFOPEDIA: Small arms developed since the late 1960s have seen their flourishing in more recent years due to increased funding for the Development Committee. Based on designs created by General Mirinov, with improvements by Dr. Artemiy, Soviet short-range weapons are noted for their reliability.

      STR_USSR_LASER_RIFLES_UFOPEDIA: The crown jewel of Soviet laser technology, the rifles are considered the most important application of laser technology created by the Soviet Union. Due to the problems caused by the alien invasion, they have been put into mass production to equip the millions of soldiers of the Warsaw Pact and defend the Motherland and planet Earth.

      STR_USSR_LASER_CLOSE_RANGE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "The completion of laser compact pistols allows Soviet researchers to develop new laser weapons for light skirmishes. Soviet engineers have managed to design a close quarters combat weapon to conduct special operations against alien logistic units. These close range weapons are useful for Warsaw Pact military and foreign operators."

      STR_USSR_LASER_HEAVY_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: The new military strategy of the countries aligned with the Soviet Union prioritizes the use of heavy weapons from fortified positions to defeat a considerably superior enemy. To this end, the Committee has ordered the creation of powerful weapons for a war of attrition. They are not very comfortable to use, but their firepower is unmatched.

      STR_UNITED_WE_STAND_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The report of the interrogation of the captured alien has reached the Security Council. The members are widely surprised (and we could notice that they are also frightened) by the reliable proof of aggressive alien life. Until this moment, it had been an open secret. The resolution they passed was resolutive: humanity must take action before it is too late. Secretary-General Waldheim is going to make a statement in front of the General Assembly, but rumor has it that we will be sent on some kind of joint operation. We are standing by."

      STR_IMPROVED_BOMBER_UFOPEDIA: "Returning to the abandoned project of the XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber, in collaboration with North American Aviation, improved avionics, new weapons and navigation systems have been integrated, as well as a new engine and fuselage built in Alien Alloys, which substantially increases the speed and combat range of the bomber. It will be available for its manufacture in the workshop."

      STR_IMPROVED_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Returning to the abandoned project of the XF-108 Rapier long-range supersonic interceptor, in collaboration with North American Aviation, improved avionics, new weapons and navigation systems have been integrated, as well as a new engine and fuselage built in Alien Alloys, which substantially increases the speed and combat range of the fighter. It will be available for its manufacture in the workshop."

      STR_IMPROVED_VTOL_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA: "Working in close collaboration with Soviet designer Mikhail Mil, this attack and transport helicopter based on the Hind model (which has just entered service with Soviet military forces) includes a fuselage built entirely of Alien Alloys that considerably reduces its weight. In addition, the cockpit has been redesigned to incorporate new avionics systems. It is equipped with a variety of rockets and cannons, turning it into a 'flying tank'."

      STR_IMPROVED_SATELLITE_UFOPEDIA: "New gravitational wave and infrared detection systems, in collaboration with NASA, ESRO and the Soviet Space Program have culminated in a new military reconnaissance satellite model. At the request of Soviet scientists, a slot has been incorporated to mount cannons of various types and calibres, in order to defend the satellite from UFO attacks when flying over Earth's orbit. We hope that this model will help us to improve the surveillance of our planet in the face of the alien threat."

      STR_ALLOY_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA: "Research into the alloys used in alien craft and weaponry opened up new avenues of super-material construction. While this research permits the creation of the precise rare-earth doped alloys used by the alien forces, this construction technology is more effective and efficient at creating 'super alloys' than terrestrial electrical sintering, or chemical vapor deposition. Creating new alloys with this methodology will facilitate the manufacture of new armor, improved small arms and allow for further research into directed-energy weapon technology. Additionally, this technology can be used to synthesize new chemical compounds for a variety of applications from explosives, power cells to medical technology."

      STR_ALLOY_AEROSPACE_UFOPEDIA: "With the understanding gleaned from the alien alloy manufacturing process, the techniques for creating super alloys and chemical compounds suited for explosive warheads, penetrators and propellant can be applied to aircraft weaponry.  This should improve our air to air weaponry greatly."

      STR_IMPROVED_CRAFT_ACCURACY_UFOPEDIA: "Alien saucer craft we have encountered proved to be quite a challenge for the terrestrial air-to-air weaponry. While our means of dealing damage are certainly effective even against alien armor, the weapon targeting and missile guidance systems are found to be severely lacking.\n\nAfter researching the navigation systems installed on alien craft, we believe we can now propose several improvements to the terrestrial air-to-air weaponry. By tuning key components we could greatly improve their effectiveness against alien evasive maneuvers and allow for better tracking of alien saucers.\n\n NEW AUXILIARY UNIT: TARGETING POD"

      STR_IMPROVED_CRAFT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that the armor plating employed by conventional earth aircraft will provide little protection when engaging all but the smallest UFOs.\n\nWe have experimented with the newly discovered Alien Alloys and we believe we can now propose several ways to upgrade our current terrestrial craft. By employing lighter materials we also expect to achieve improvements other areas, such as avionics and maximum thrust. After some additional experiments and testing we believe this new kind of materials, will be ready for production. Our new aircrafts with be manufactured with this new alloy.\n\nAs we are neither legally allowed nor sufficiently equipped to manufacture a whole craft, we have negotiated a deal with the U.N. Security Council for the purpose of this project. Upon our request they will provide us with the base hull and all relevant parts. NEW AUXILIARY UNIT: ALLOY CRAFT ARMOR"

      STR_ELERIUM_FUSION_UFOPEDIA: "We have managed to decipher the secret behind the handling of the mysterious mineral 115, the Elerium. This mineral is similar in use to our radioactive minerals such as uranium or plutonium, but thousands of times more efficient and with less radiation, although it is still dangerous to be near the Elerium without adequate protection. Being isolated with a strong magnetic field it is possible to stabilize it enough to use it safely in weapons, ammunition, armor and vehicles. Its enormous energy is released by being bombarded with highly charged particles. These types of reactors can make nuclear power obsolete in a matter of years. We must do even more research to apply it to various uses, although for the moment we can use Elerium to make ammunition for our existing weapons."

      STR_ALIEN_CAPITAL_SHIPS_UFOPEDIA: "Huge alien battle ships are the equivalent of our naval warships. They lead the most important missions, such as Infiltrations, Terror Sites and Retaliations. Equipped with powerful shields and a large amount of armor. The gravity and the enormous air drag makes them very slow in our atmosphere. Most take point-defense cannons, very fast but weak and short-range. Our nuclear missiles are made to knock them down."

      STR_ALIEN_FIGHTER_SHIPS_UFOPEDIA: "Ships dedicated exclusively to the interception of our aircraft, both civil and military. Fast, agile, with very powerful weapons. They are a more than worthy rival for our fighters and bombers. Our pilots call them 'Hunter Killers' for the enormous efficiency in doing both tasks."

      STR_ALIEN_SCOUT_SHIPS_UFOPEDIA: "Recon, exploration and surveillance ships. They are relatively slow and their weapons are not very powerful, they usually precede the main ships. Some will try to attack our planes, but they are no match for them."

      STR_ALIEN_SUPPORT_SHIPS_UFOPEDIA: "Highly specialized ships with specific tasks of each one. Their weapons are designed for self-defense, although they are dangerous for some types of aircraft. Caution is recommended."

      STR_ALIEN_SHIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "Some of the alien craft are equipped with force shields that may absorb damage from missiles and bullets. They are not invincible, but they can greatly increase UFO's resistance at unexpected levels. Usually the bigger craft use them, however some small ships equip them as well."

#     STR_ALLOY_CRAFT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: Armor plates made of Alien Alloys, designed to be installed in  UNEXCOM aircrafts to increase durability. Damage Max +100

      STR_IMPROVED_LIGHT_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Recent advances in materials science have allowed us, in collaboration with the Raytheon company, to create a new model of lightweight missile, equipped with a modern chassis built entirely with Alien Alloys. Because it is lighter, it can carry more of a heavier warhead. In addition, avionics systems designed by our engineers, based on air combat so far, have allowed to improve the built-in heat tracker."

      STR_IMPROVED_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Using our knowledge gained from using heavy radar-guided missiles against UFOs, we have been able to isolate the waves they reflect to some extent. This new active radar is considerably larger and more advanced. It is still in prototype stages, but the new R-72 Scimitar missile, built with the help of NPO Vympel, includes the new Alien Alloys frames and all the explosives that could fit inside the missile."

      STR_IMPROVED_GATLING_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "General Electric engineers have been very enthusiastic about improving their famous Gatling M61 Vulcan cannon. They have visited our laboratory and engineering bay to support us in creating a new gun based on the Vulcan. By using the famous Alien Alloys, we have designed a more efficient weapon that resists the intense heat of the weapon much better. We are satisfied with the result. Improved Revolver research is required to produce the ammunition."

      STR_IMPROVED_REVOLVER_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "Our gunsmiths had the idea to use the BK-27 gun created by Mauser to improve it with the new Alien Alloys. The result could not have been better, and even the designers in West Germany congratulated our team of engineers. Being lighter, we were able to put in a new firing mechanism and a considerably stronger barrel. After firing 10,000 rounds, the barrel barely warmed up at all. The extra firepower will benefit our pilots. Improved Gatling research is required to produce the ammunition."

      STR_IMPROVED_SUPER_HEAVY_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Nuclear weapons remain a difficult subject to deal with, even though this war is being waged against non-human enemies. We have obtained authorization from the UNSC to upgrade our Falcon missiles using the new technology being researched. They have allowed us to design a new fuselage and avionics system (which translates into more range and accuracy), but we still have to keep the same W54 warhead, so the damage inflicted will remain the same. To produce it, we must use an existing Falcon and modify it completely."

      STR_IMPROVED_ROCKET_UFOPEDIA: "This project is incredibly cheap, since we are using a cost-efficient platform as a base. The unguided Mk 4 Hydra 70 rocket, used by the USAF since the Korean War to provide close support, has been adapted with new Alien Alloy materials and an improved penetration head, made of tungsten. Laboratory tests have proven its reliability. The Soviets are said to be very interested in this weapon to equip the Hind they have provided us with, a further sign that the rivalries between the USA and the USSR are diminishing... at least a little."

      STR_ADVANCED_BOMBER_UFOPEDIA: "Tactical bomber project implementing hybrid and stealth technology For this project we have moved away from classic aircraft construction and have taken a more 'organic' design.  In tests it has proven to be considerably invisible to the radar used by our aircraft, and we hope that this same feature will be used in aerial combat against UFOs."

      STR_ADVANCED_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a novel project. Grumman has created a new heavy naval fighter designed to protect American fleets and our diplomatic liaisons have managed to contact this company to design an aircraft entirely built by UNEXCOM. Using the F-14 Tomcat as a base, we have added for the first time stealth technology based on a modified version of the Alien Alloys, retaining the large weapon carrying capacity and sweep wings. "

      STR_AIR_STRIKES_UFOPEDIA: "The Council has provided us access to close air support from airbases located in council nations near the area of operations. Though expensive, they can grant a tactical advantage if used correctly. UNEXCOM operatives can call in close air support by priming and throwing a signal smoke grenade. The air support will take a few turns to arrive, it is advised this time is used to make sure no friendly combatants are in the blast zone. Signal smoke grenades should not be used indoors, as this prevents the close air support from finding the target, meaning the attack run will not be completed"

      STR_OUTSOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "Due to the growing size of our airwing, our engineering department cannot keep up with the demand of manufacturing ammunition for the advanced weapons systems developed by our research department. Therefore the council has approved our request to move production of certain weapon system munitions into factories maintained by council members. While this arrangement will free up our resources to focus on other things, giving individual council nations access to powerful new weapons might have repercussions once this conflict is over"

      STR_OLYMPUS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that the only way to end this invasion is to attack the enemy directly at their door. We cannot win a war of attrition on Earth, it only costs us more men and cities. The Security Council determined to reactivate Project Olympus, focused on creating an interplanetary strike force. The blueprints and partially build ships were stored in a secure vault for 10 years until the worst event happened and our planet became besieged by alien forces. It will take us a while to get everything ready, in the meantime we must buy as much time as possible."

      STR_OLYMPUS_ORION_UFOPEDIA: "The design was created in the early 60s by NASA as an effective mean to get to Mars and beyond using the existing technology. But the fears of an alien invasion motivated president Kennedy and Premier Kruschev to propose an armed version. Our most reliable and effective way to use nuclear weapons is to adapt them into shaped charges (similar of those used by Casaba Howitzers) to propel the pusher plate behind the ship. Their armament is composed of naval batteries, ballistic missile racks and 20mm CWIS cannons plus Hangar storage for 6 smaller vehicles."

      STR_OLYMPUS_SHUTTLE_UFOPEDIA: "This project has its origins in the late 1960s, when several concepts were explored by NASA for a reusable space vehicle to replace the Apollo capsules. A space plane, which would take off vertically and land on a runway. Due to the invasion, we have applied new materials, as well as additional shielding and engines for VTOL maneuvers. The X-73 Raider is the only aircraft in our arsenal that can transport troops into space."

      STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our Recon probes found the characteristic gravitational signals emitted by UFOs in the surface of the Moon. More specifically, Tycho Crater. Pyramid-like structures with what seems AA batteries and turrets has been spotted. Our task force is getting ready for deployment using the new space shuttles. NASA Command will help with us recon and logistics support and the Soviet forces will land alongside us. "

      STR_DESTINATION_MARS_UFOPEDIA: "The Viking probes sent to Mars have found the location of the suspected alien base on a region identified as Cydonia. The most shocking news are the clear evidence of a city-like complex and what appears to be a humanoid face. The information has been shared to the UN General Assembly and the Security Council has approved the creation of the United Nations Space Command to coordinate the joint efforts of the American, Soviet and European aerospace forces. The Orion Nuclear Battleships are almost ready to go. We need to hold the invaders on the ground as much as we can to gain more time for the invasion fleet."

      STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "We have completed the construction of the three Orion Nuclear Battleships. Each World Power has christened each one and provided crew and landing troops, with vehicle complement of Sabre Exoatmospheric Fighters and Raider Shuttles. The Ares Expeditionary Force will be composed of UNS Enterprise, UNS Marathon and UNS Stalingrad and will be take us three weeks to get to Mars orbit. The time has come. Operation Downfall will begin as soon as we are ready to take off."

      STR_EXOATMOSPHERIC_FIGHTERS_UFOPEDIA: "To take the fight back to the aliens, we need to be able to fight them outside of our atmosphere. To do this a new generation of fighter craft has been created. Capable of fighting with equal ability both outside and inside our atmosphere, these craft can also reach immense speeds by exiting the atmosphere and therefore avoiding air resistance altogether."
      STR_NONE_UC_UFOPEDIA: Standard Field Combat Uniform, provided by United Nations to all UNEXCOM troops at the incorporation to our forces, includes a darker version of the emblematic Blue Beret used by U.N. Peacekeeping forces. Lightweight and comfortable, it wasn't meant to stop plasma bolts, but can be enough to stop light bullets.

      STR_PILOT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Standard G-suit used by UNEXCOM combat pilots. Made to resist high levels of acceleration forces, it's very practical (has plenty of pockets), and durable (includes fire retardant clothing). Its appearance is usually similar to a jumpsuit.

      STR_SPECIAL_FORCES_UNIFORM_UFOPEDIA: A lighter version of the military uniform worn by regular SoldiersAndArmors allows the Special Forces Operator to move freely on the battlefield. It has no protection against ballistic weapons, but that does not prevent it from being used by the world's elite military. Has a boost to bravery and morale.

      STR_MERCENARY_UNIFORM_UFOPEDIA: The mercenary uniform is a light and comfortable military attire, generally similar to that worn by government armed forces. It is practical enough to allow for use in clandestine operations in a variety of environments and climates.

      STR_COMBAT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: Composite armor system, combining Alien Alloy and prototype Kevlar ballistic plates in a bulletproof vest and helmet made of the same material. Given the current limitations of armor manufacturing, it is still a bit heavy and uncomfortable to wear, but it certainly protects the user from light ballistic fire and some indirect plasma fire. Painted blue at our request.

      STR_USA_PROTOTYPE_ARMOR_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: Research into the development of flak jackets used by American troops in Vietnam has resulted in this prototype of individual armor. It uses a prototype Kevlar vest (materiel yet unused on large scale) with Alien Alloys plates to prevent damage to the wearer. It is considerably lighter than other metal-based armor and could be the future of infantry armor. We sent the blueprints to the R+D team immediately.

      STR_DELTA_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "German prototype armor for bomb disposal teams. It offers an incredible resistance to explosive and armor piercing damage, although it is heavy and causes fatigue to the user. The front part is more resistant than the back. It includes a MG3 general machine gun, with integrated brackets on the soldier's right arm to improve grip and precision, as well as to reduce its weight."

      STR_NATO_PROTOTYPE_ARMOR_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: Research on personal armor built with Alien Alloys has supported the research of European scientists and engineers. A prototype of armor to defuse explosives has been redesigned to use the new alien material. The plans have been sent to our R&D team for immediate construction.

      STR_RIOT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Advanced Soviet prototype armor, derived from a project for a new riot armor for Spetsnaz special forces, is entirely built in Alien Alloy, includes a visor to protect the user's face from impacts and bullets, although this limits their visibility and mobility a bit. Includes a riot shield 'IM-21 Krepost', to deflect frontal damage."

      STR_USSR_PROTOTYPE_ARMOR_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA: The prototype riot armor designed for the Spetsnaz forces has been improved using the new Alien Alloys. Field tests were used on Soviet volunteers and is able to withstand the direct impact of light weapons. The shield that it has integrated increases even more its resistance, almost at the same of armored vehicles. The schematics have been sent to our R&D team for its construction.

      STR_HEAVY_PERSONAL_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: This is a heavier suit of personal armor, combining the best protective technologies of both human and alien origin, heat resistant aramid blended with alien alloy fibers with carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide plates laminated with Alien Alloys. This suit sacrifices some carry weight and mobility to provide superior protection.

      STR_SCOUT_POWER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: This item combines Power Suit technology and Personal Armor frame to create armor focusing on increasing a soldier's mobility. However, this focus on speed and a need to maximize wearer's field of vision limits the suit's protective capabilities.

      STR_SCOUT_FLYING_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: This armor is an improvement over the Scout Power Armor, incorporating advances from the Flying Suit technology. The Scout Flying Armor offers the best mobility so far, combining faster movement and flight. But despite our advances, the suit is still less armored than a basic Power Suit.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_A7L_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Fully pressurized suit, perfect for extra vehicular activities in difficult terrain. Improved model of the A7L suit used by the American astronauts of the Apollo missions.  Includes sections of Alien Alloys to lessen the discomfort of the suit, but still limits the movements and reactions of the user. Includes magnetic boots.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_A7LB_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Combat variant of the A7 spacesuit, integrates Alien Alloy plates on the shoulders and legs to provide extra protection to limbs. Its main feature its a ballistic helmet inspired in LEVA (Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly) to provide increased resistance to damage that may break the helmet and compromise the survivability of the operator. Includes magnetic boots.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_A7_MMU_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Special A7 spacesuit equipped with a prototype Manned Maneuvering Unit designed by NASA. This 'jetpack' enables untethered EVA operations without restrictions. The propellant used is gaseous nitrogen, stored on armored tanks on the back of the MMU. It contains enough propellant to have 6 hours of EVA. It is smaller than the Soviet counterpart, the SPK.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHET94_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Fully pressurized spacesuit, designed and build on the Soviet Union. Originally meant to be used on the civilian Moon and Mars space programs only, it was quickly put on widespread production to be equipped by Warsaw Pact cosmonauts. Incorporates some parts made with Alien Alloys to help improve mobility of the user. Includes magnetic boots.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHET94B_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Combat variant of Krechet-94 suit, includes Alien Alloy pauldrons and leg armored plates to absorb damage to limbs. It's main difference with the standard Krechet-94 is a build-in Alien Alloys vest, to greatly increase the resistance to damage to torso.

      STR_ASTRONAUT_KRECHETMMU_SPACESUIT_UC_UFOPEDIA: Specialized version of the Krechet spacesuit, features a build-in propulsion unit named SPK. Uses compressed oxygen as the propulsion system, stored and protected within the backpack-like structure. It has an autonomy of seven hours of extravehicular activity (EVA). Well liked by Warsaw Pact cosmonauts, it is larger than the American counterpart, the MMU.

      STR_FERRET_CAR_UFOPEDIA:  The Ferret Scout Car is a British armoured fighting vehicle designed and built for reconnaissance purposes. These vehicles are provided by the United Nations, very used by the UN Peacekeeping Forces all around the globe. It has reduced armor, but is equipped with two powerful .50 caliber M2 Machine Guns (50 rds) and a smoke grenade dispenser (6 rds).

      STR_SHERIDAN_UFOPEDIA: The M551 Sheridan AR/AAV (Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle) is a light tank developed by the United States, provided to UNEXCOM for ground combat support. It's designed to be landed by parachute and to swim across rivers. It's armed with the technically advanced M81E1 152mm gun/launcher (20 rds), adapted for the use of the MGM-51 Shillelagh guided anti-tank missile (9 rds).

      STR_BMD1_UFOPEDIA: The BMD-1 is a Soviet airborne amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicle, first introduced in 1969. BMD stands for Boyevaya Mashina Desanta (literally 'Combat Vehicle of the Airborne'). It can be dropped by parachute and can be carried by our C-130 Hercules and although it resembles the BMP-1 it is in fact much smaller. It's main armament is composed of a 2A28 Grom 73mm semi-auto gun (40 rds) and a PKT coaxial MG (50 rds).

      STR_SALADIN_CAR_UFOPEDIA:  Excellent 6x6 armored car of British origin, was designed in the 50s and has been exported to numerous nations since then, proving its worth in Middle East countries. It is also used by the United Nations. Its Royal Ordnance Factory L5A1 76mm Gun (30 rds) is not designed to combat tanks, but to destroy fortifications and light vehicles. It has a coaxial M1919A4 machine gun (50 rds) to combat infantry.

      STR_IMP_TANK_CHASSIS_UFOPEDIA: Our tanks have proven to be highly useful on the battlefield when supporting our troops in their missions. However, the escalation in the conflict and the increase in the losses of the same, have led our engineers and scientists, together with tank developers of the world, to create a new type of tank using our new scientific advances. For this project we are developing a powerful laser cannon similar to the one mounted on airplanes, the 'Laser Gun, Model 34-3 Heavy Anti Tank Laser Cannon', we will use it in the developed tank.

      STR_LEGIONNAIRE_TANK_UFOPEDIA: Result of a joint project of USA, West Germany, UK and UNEXCOM engineers, the Light Assault Tank XM22 Legionnaire is armored with a strong armor based on Alien Alloys. It uses a unique cannon, the LGM34-3H ATLC, which fires high-powered laser munitions. Their 'cartridges' are actually one-use-per-shot batteries, physically similar to 90mm shells but 10 times more powerful (30 rds). It's support weapon is a turret mounted Laser Minigun (100 rds).

      STR_THIN_MAN_UFOPEDIA: "The Thin Man is an alien creature fused with human DNA to create what seems to be an infiltration agent. It has been shown to showcase some kind of psionic abilities, something that no doubt assists it when establishing networks of operatives."

      STR_THIN_MAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "While on the surface the subject, which we've christened as 'Thin Man', seems human, its internal organs show significant deviation. The Thin Mans DNA is similar to a regular humans, but it contains portions unlike anything found on earth. The subject is most likely a result of genetic manipulation."

      STR_ALIEN_ASSOCIATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "The capture of a high ranking terrorist has lead to an alarming development, the terrorist organisations we've been facing seem to have links to extraterrestrials. Multiple terrorist leaders have been seen armed with weaponry only seen before during highly classified encounters with alien life. The origins of these weapons must be tracked before knowledge of them spreads too far to contain, and before the terrorist can get their hands on anything with which they could cause significant damage."

      STR_TERRORIST_HQ_UFOPEDIA: "Thanks to the information gained from an high ranking terrorist and the assistance of multiple intelligence agencies we've been able to track down the source of the alien weapons. They seem to have been distributed by a small cell seemingly operating from a sizable suburban house. A raid into the building should put an stop to their operation."

      STR_TERRORISTS_UFOPEDIA: Terrorists are a diverse group of political, religious and ideological radicals who use violence and fear to impose their ideals or make demands on the world's governments. Each cell is independent of the others, but they use similar equipment and weaponry. They are extremely dangerous because they are not afraid to die.

      STR_TERRORISTS_OPERATIONS_UFOPEDIA: Terrorist operations are often financed by extremist political or religious factions in countries around the world, who use terrorists as the means to achieve their goals without getting their hands dirty. They usually demand a ransom in the form of money or the release of prisoners loyal to their faction. Their activity has been greatly increased by the massive export of weapons from the Superpowers to Third World countries.

      STR_TERRORIST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This is an ordinary human, with nothing we would not have seen in another member of our species and as easy to kill as an ordinary soldier. Some were equipped with bulletproof vests under their clothes, although in general their attire is that of a civilian, with some tactical elements of military origin, probably obtained illegally on the black market.

      STR_SMALL_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: "Though this UFO may not look like much, it is a fearsome combatant. Despite its lack of an aerodynamic design, it is faster than any aircraft found on Earth."

      STR_TROOP_LANDER_UFOPEDIA: "This massive vessel seems to serve as the aliens main method of transporting troops. Though being a transport, it is equipped with an extensive point-defence system, making it a severe threat to any assailant."

      STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER: "Sectoid Commander"

      STR_CYBERSPHERE: "Cybersphere"
      STR_PROBE: "Probe"
      STR_SECTOID_PSION_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Sectoid has a specially build 'harness' on its body. Connected directly on the brain, provides the user of extra energy to focus and expand the intensity of the psionic energy. Basically an antenna and a battery for the user's brain. It's use seems focused on controlling minds of lesser beings."
      STR_SECTOID_PSION_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Psions' are Sectoids specially trained to control alien beasts, even some allied aliens with lower intelligence. The 'Psionic Harness' transmits the orders directly into the subconscious mind and allows the Psion to control every aspect of the beast, from movement to neuronal activity... Pretty much like a puppeteer."
      STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Sectoid features a larger head than it's brethren. Looks naturally grown, as there are no signs of surgical procedures. The body seems to struggle to resist the weight of the larger cranium and the brain matter inside. Obviously, a perfect target for our snipers."
      STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "A highly evolved Sectoid, it's cranial cavity was genetically expanded to fit a larger brain. The Commander has a vast array of tactical and cultural knowledge, turning it into a literal genius on the battlefield. The heightened intelligence allows to take control of larger and more complex squads of aliens than a regular Sectoid."
      STR_MECHTOID_AUTOPSY: "Mechtoid Autopsy"
      STR_MECHTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The broken chassis of this mechanized unit reveals a complex array of tubbing and armored plates, along with two powerful legs. The propulsion unit looks a miniature Elerium reactor, but protected to avoid killing the user. Deeply inside, lies the rotten corpse of a Sectoid. Probably the pilot of the armored unit. The arm-mounted Heavy Plasma Cannons are very dangerous, but relatively slow to use."
      STR_MECHTOID_UFOPEDIA: "In order to bolster the strength of Sectoid squads, a Navigator boards a tall mechanized bipedal armor. Just the head remains unprotected. Powerful servomotors allow the 'Mechtoid' to run across large distances with ease. Compared to other units, features a relatively lighter armor (albeit still stronger than a regular human armored vehicle). It's crewman is still capable of using Psionics unhindered."
      STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "In order to increase the durability of Sectoids in frontline combat against us, they have developed a fairly effective powered armor. Fully enclosed and with a breathing system, the user can withstand NBC environments and deflect standard human ballistic and plasma weaponry. They are susceptible to explosions and lasers, however."
      STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "A fearsome alien robotic unit, it's often the vanguard of enemy assaults. Heavy armored and highly resistant to most damage types (lasers and explosives seem to be effective). It's biggest weakness is also it's main weapon: dual Laser Gatling-like Cannons can easily dispatch most infantry with a hailstorm of energy beams."
      STR_ARMORED_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "The Shock Mutons are specially trained to engage against highly organized enemy forces. Their armor protects them from all kind of damage and their enclosed helmet allows them to operate on toxic environments. The foot are unprotected, being a vulnerable side."
      STR_ARMORED_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "An extremely skilled Muton warrior, employed as both commanders of large alien contingents and personal guard for the Ethereal leaders. Their armors and helmets are decorated with large ornaments, shown with pride as a sign of status. They are the peak of the Muton hierarchy."
      STR_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "While regular Mutons are highly dependant on a psionic link with a superior being like Ethereals and Sectoids, this kind of alien serves as a NCOs for alien squads. They have developed a stronger individualism and will power. This is enough to command other aliens and support higher castes."
      STR_ARMORED_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "Serving as the usual frontline and recon unit is costly due the poor protection of the standard harness. This is why the Floater soldiers have been improved with armor whose protection rate is similar to other frontline units. This effectively doubles the survival rate within their ranks."
      STR_STRIDER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a subspecies of the Floaters, stronger and more resilient than their cybernetic-enhanced cousins. We think on them like the Homo Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens: two similar species with different specializations. They often wear heavy armor and provide close combat support to Floaters."
      STR_STRIDER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This alien is very similar to the Floater, perhaps a variation of them or a genetic relative. The cranium looks more sturdy but with more primitive facial features. The legs and arms are muscular in appearance, probably indicating this alien is used on heavy work."
      STR_PROBE_UFOPEDIA: "A small and very distinctive robotic unit. Used on survey and scientific missions, it's widely used to conduct recon over the area subject of study. Carries a defensive laser gun. Slow, but could kill a human soldier if left unchecked."
      STR_PROBE_AUTOPSY: "Probe Autopsy"
      STR_PROBE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The small hovering unit seems to be used to scout ahead the mission site and provide light support to other combat units. The chassis seems light and somewhat weak, but we have reports of a small energy weapon used on what appears self-defense."
      STR_CYBERSPHERE_UFOPEDIA: "A very specialized robot drone, used to seek, detect and pin down possible objectives. The data collected by this unit is relayed directly into the brains of the alien squad members, effectively turning this drone into another pair of eyes. It's extremely fast and agile."
      STR_CYBERSPHERE_AUTOPSY: "Cybersphere Autopsy"
      STR_CYBERSPHERE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The wreck reveals few things about the purpose of the flying object. It doesn't have any weapon and the chassis is really thin and light, it barely resists a couple of rifle rounds. The antigravity propulsion unit is very compact too, looks like it's meant mostly as recon and survey tasks."
      STR_ALIEN_RANKS: "Alien Ranks"
      STR_ALIEN_RANKS_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens have a cohesive, organized and highly specialized military. Similar to human armies, each member of a squad has assigned a role and function. It seems they haven't developed the concept of concealment nor camuflaje, because they often use bright colors to identify each rank. Capturing them could give us a better perspective of our enemy. Red is meant to leaders. Brown is used on technicians and combat engineers. Blue is employed by sanitary and medical personnel. Orange is assigned to pilots and ship crew. Green is the color of the regular soldiers. It's unknown if the colors meant something for them or not. But at least, makes things easier to us."
      STR_ARMORED_ALIENS: "Armored Aliens"
      STR_ARMORED_ALIENS_UFOPEDIA: "Personal armor is widely distributed to alien infantry. However, it's use is restricted according the mission carried by the crew of a ship. If the personnel is conducting 'scientific' missions, lighter weapons and few or no personal armor are used. However, if the enemy expects to engage in heavy combat, said restrictions are lifted and more destructive equipment is used without hesitation. We are the one of the few, if not the first, race who resisted longer than a couple of weeks. We could expect a change in their equipment strategy anytime soon."
